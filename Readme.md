# 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Analysis System (YOLOv8 + OCR + Streamlit)

An end-to-end **vehicle detection and traffic monitoring system** powered by **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. This project is designed for real-world applications like smart cities, traffic law enforcement, autonomous mobility, and urban analytics.

Deployed with **Streamlit** and hosted via **Hugging Face Spaces** using a custom **Docker** environment.

## 📸 What it Does

- 🚗 Detects cars, buses, motorbikes, pedestrians, and trams
- 🧠 Tracks individual vehicles over time with object IDs
- ⚡ Estimates real speed using perspective transformation
- 🚨 Detects speed violations
- 🔍 Reads license plates using OCR (EasyOCR)
- 📊 Generates real-time traffic statistics
- 📄 Outputs automatic PDF report with charts and violations
- 🌐 Allows users to upload their own videos via web app
